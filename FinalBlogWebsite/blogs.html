        <p class="font1">Diwali, Dewali, Divali, or Deepavali, also known as the Festival of Lights, related to
            Jain Diwali, Bandi Chhor Divas, Tihar, Swanti, Sohrai, and Bandna, is a Dharmic religious festival and one
            of the
            most important festivals within Hinduism.[ In Hinduism, it generally lasts five days (or six in some regions
            of
            India), and is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition)
            and
            Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November). It symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light over darkness,
            good
            over evil, and knowledge over ignorance". The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of
            prosperity and
            Ganesha, god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles, with many other regional traditions connecting the
            holiday to
            Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or
            Vishvakarman.
            Furthermore, it is a celebration of the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and
            his
            brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile. <br>

            In the lead-up to Deepavali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and
            workplaces
            with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colorful art circle patterns). During Diwali, people wear their finest
            clothes,
            illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with saaki (earthen lamp), diyas and rangoli, perform
            worship
            ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth, light fireworks, and partake in family feasts,
            where
            mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared. Originally a Hindu festival, Diwali is now also celebrated by Jains
            and Sikhs.
            It is a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain diaspora. <br>

            The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts.
            The
            common celebratory practices are common as festival of light, however there are minor differences from state
            to
            state in India. Diwali/Dewali/Deepavali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami (Dussehra,
            Dasara,
            Dashain, Dashahara) festival, with Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the
            festival when
            celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as rangolis. Some
            regions of
            India start Diwali festivities the day before Dhanteras with Govatsa Dwadashi. The second day is Naraka
            Chaturdashi.
            The third day is the day of Lakshmi Puja and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some parts of
            India, the
            day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and Balipratipada (Padwa). Some Hindu communities
            mark the
            last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent, which is dedicated to the bond between sister and brother,
            while
            other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as Vishwakarma Puja and observe it by performing
            maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.</p>
            <p class="font1">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

                Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
                requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older
                people and
                those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
                or
                cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously
                ill or die
                at any age. <br>
    
                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the
                virus
                spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a
                properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when
                it’s your
                turn and follow local guidance. <br>
    
                The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough,
                sneeze,
                speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is
                important
                to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and
                self-isolate
                until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>
