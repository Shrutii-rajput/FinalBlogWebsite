        <p class="font1">1. Dogs live to love and please us. My mom told me a story the other day about how the vet
            had to poke my labradoodle with a needle about six times before getting it in the right spot. And the whole
            time, my
            dog just sat there with his head in my mom's lap, staring up at her, waiting for it to be over. My mom asked
            the vet
            why dogs are like this, why they will endure pain without fighting it. And he said something that broke her
            heart.
            He said they just want to please people, even if that means sitting through pain. And really, it's true. All
            dogs
            want is for their human to be happy and throw the ball. And when their human is not happy, they won't throw
            the
            ball. Therefore, dogs make it their mission to make their humans happy. <br>

            2. They seem to have sixth sense when it comes to compassion and understanding. Dogs can listen without
            judging. OK,
            so I don't sit and talk to my dogs. Not about serious matters at least. But when I'm upset, they know. They
            curl up
            next to me and rest their head on my chest, staring at me with their big, innocent eyes, radiating love.
            Something
            about that is so powerful to me. While they can't speak, they know their humans so well and can pick it up
            when
            something isn't right. And more than that, they try to fix whatever is wrong, the best they know how. <br>

            3. They can cuddle better than anyone. I'd rather cuddle with my dog than my boyfriend most of the time.
            Every night
            before bed she climbs up and lies on my chest. She would sleep like that if I would let her. Instead, she
            sleeps
            right on my feet, which cannot be comfortable. But it comes back to love. She loves her humans, and wants to
            be as
            close to them as possible even when it means it's less comfortable for her. My 70-pound lab mix will do the
            same. He
            climbs above my head and curls around my shoulders when I am sitting on a chair. He has no idea that this
            isn't
            normal. Again, he just wants to be close. Dogs are the best cuddlers, period.</p>
